## Micro Frontend Architecture

Micro-frontend architecture is a design approach for building web applications where a single application is composed of multiple smaller, independent frontends. It applies the principles of microservices to the frontend, enabling teams to work on separate pieces of the application independently, using potentially different technologies.

### Benefits
1. Scalability: Enables teams to scale development by working on isolated parts of the application simultaneously.
2. Independence: Teams can choose technologies best suited for their micro-frontend without impacting others.
3. Deployment Flexibility: Each micro-frontend can be updated and deployed without redeploying the entire application.
4. Fault Isolation: Issues in one micro-frontend are less likely to affect the entire application.

### Challenges
1. Integration Complexity: Ensuring seamless communication and UI consistency between micro-frontends can be challenging.
2. Performance: Multiple micro-frontends can increase the app's initial load time due to the need to load multiple bundles or resources.
3. State Management: Sharing state across micro-frontends requires careful planning.
4. Version Control: Managing versions across multiple teams and micro-frontends can lead to conflicts.

### When to Reconsider:
Before choosing micro-frontends, evaluate:
1. Scale: Is your application large and complex enough?
2. Team Structure: Do you have multiple teams working on separate features?
3. Longevity: Will the project benefit from modularity in the long term?

### Categories of integrations
1. Web Components: Use standard web components to encapsulate micro-frontends
2. Build-Time Integration: Combine micro-frontends during the build process into a single application.
3. Runtime Integration:
    - Server-Side: Assemble micro-frontends on the server before delivering them to the client.
    - Client-Side: Load and render micro-frontends dynamically in the browser.
